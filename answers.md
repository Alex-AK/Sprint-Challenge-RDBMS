### Why do tables need a primary key?

- In order to reference an item quickly and without conflict, rows (items) need a primary key.
- A primary key that the database auto increments on new items and must be unique.

### What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

- Foreign key (fk)

### What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

- You need to put two foreign keys in a table, that references two separate tables. This is a many to many relationship.
